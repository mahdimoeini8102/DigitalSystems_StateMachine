# DigitalSystems_StateMachine
This is the fifth project of the Digital System course at the university under the supervision of [Dr. Zainalabedin Navabi Shirazi](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~navabi) and it is about state machines. In this project, I have implemented two sequence detectors using SystemVerilog HDL(Hardware Description Language) and then I have synthesized them using [Intel® Quartus® II](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiSyaGylN-AAxWyg_0HHRvBAs0QFnoECB0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsoftware-kit%2F666221%2Fintel-quartus-ii-web-edition-design-software-version-13-1-for-windows.html&usg=AOvVaw3QVPl63a7llUDFiBNAMJ3K&opi=89978449). One is based on [Moore Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine) and the other one is based on [Mealy Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine).
